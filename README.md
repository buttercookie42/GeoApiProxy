# GeoApiProxy

Proxies the subset of the GeoNames API used by GeoSetter and uses an alternative reverse geocoding service for hopefully better results.

## Usage

You'll need a web server (preferably Apache, otherwise you need to set up the URL rewriting yourself) and PHP 7. If you have some web space available, you might be able to simply use that, otherwise something running locally on your computer is fine, too. You'll also need an API key for the OpenCage geocoding service and insert it into its required place in proxy.php.
Then, copy everything into a folder of your choice underneath your web root. Note that due to how GeoSetter accesses the GeoNames API, the proxy service *must* be reachable via HTTP, *not* HTTPS!

Once you've done that, you can test it by opening http://\<your-domain>/\<your-path>/debug?lat=51.477&lng=0&username=\<your GeoNames API user name>. If everything is working correctly, you should get some reverse geocoding data for the Greenwich Observatory.
At that point, you might also want to change the default language preferences, as the default values for LANGUAGE_MAPPING might not be that useful if you aren't me :-)

Next, before launching GeoSetter you need to clear it's location data cache by deleting *%AppData%\GeoSetter\location_cache.dat*, otherwise you'll be getting stale data for any coordinates you've already looked up within GeoSetter. This cache also needs to be deleted any time you make any changes to the workings of this script, in order to force GeoSetter to get the data afresh from the internet.
Finally, open GeoSetter's settings, switch to the *Internet* tab and replace the default address of the GeoNames API with the address to GeoApiProxy on your web server. Happy geocoding!
